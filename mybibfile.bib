(2005) is slightly advanced for different and anisotropic elastic moduli of phases and is employed for the study of the stress-induced cubic-monoclinic phase transition in NiTi single crystal involving all 12 martensitic variants. The model is scale-independent, without the gradient term, and it is applicable for any scale greater than 100 nm. This model includes strain softening and the corresponding transformation strain localization, and it reproduces a discrete martensitic microstructure. The model only tracks finite-width interfaces between austenite and the mixture of martensitic variants, and does not consider the interfaces between martensitic variants. The model is implemented as a UMAT subroutine in a commercial finite element (FE) package, ABAQUS. Multiple problems for a uniaxial cyclic loading are solved to study the effect of mesh, strain rate, crystal orientation, different numbers of pre-existing nuclei, and the magnitude of the athermal threshold on the stress-strain responses as well as the microstructure evolution. The obtained results exhibit that the microstructure and global stress-strain responses are practically independent of mesh discretization and the applied strain rate for relatively small strain rates. While the presence of the initial nuclei in the sample decreases the nucleation stress, it slightly increases the total energy dissipation. The observed microstructure, the sudden drop in the stress-strain curve after initiation of the martensitic transformation, and the absence of a similar jump for the reverse phase transformation are in qualitative agreement with known experiments. Changing the crystallographic orientation of the sample varies the entire behavior, namely, the variants which are involved in the phase transformation, the morphology of the associated microstructure, the stress-strain curve, and the total dissipation. Athermal threshold, in addition to the expected increase in the magnitude of hysteresis, leads to some strain hardening for the direct phase transformation."

The finite-element approach and an algorithm for the solution of corresponding problems are developed and implemented in a code FIDESYS. Cubic to tetragonal phase transformation in NiAl is studied. Various problems on stress-induced nucleation and evolution of martensitic variants in nanosize samples are solved, including a rectangular sample with single and multiple circular or elliptical nanovoids (with and without surface tension), as well as nanotube and beam. Importance of finite strain formulation is demonstrated. In particular, for the case when structural instability (buckling) of a beam is caused by phase transformation, for a geometrically linear formulation, phase transformation is suppressed. This is because finite rotation increases the energy of the system, while in a geometrically nonlinear theory energy is independent of rotation. Similar phase field and numerical approaches can be applied for twinning, dislocations, and reconstructive transformations."

The formulation accounts for variant morphologies, orientation relationships, and retained austenite that are uniquely inherent to lath martensitic microstructures. The interrelated effects of dislocation-density evolution ahead of crack front and the variant distribution of martensitic blocks on crack nucleation and propagation are investigated. It is shown that dislocation-density generation ahead of crack front can induce dislocation-density accumulations and plastic deformation that can blunt crack propagation. These predictions indicate that variant distribution of martensitic blocks can be optimized to mitigate and potentially inhibit material failure."

The approach is based on the phase-field theory, which includes the Ginzburg–Landau equations with an advanced thermodynamic potential that captures the main features of macroscopic stress–strain curves. The model consists of a coupled system of the Ginzburg–Landau equations and the static or dynamic elasticity equations, and it describes evolution of distributions of austenite and different martensitic variants in terms of corresponding order parameters. The suggested explicit finite element algorithm allows decoupling of the Ginzburg–Landau and elasticity equations for small time increments. Based on the developed phase-field approach, the simulation of the microstructure evolution for cubic-tetragonal martensitic PT in a NiAl alloy is presented for quasi-statics (i.e., without inertial forces) and dynamic formulations in the 2-D and 3-D cases. The numerical results show the significant influence of inertial effects on microstructure evolution in single- and polycrystalline samples, even for the traditional problem of relaxation of initial perturbations to stationary microstructure."

abstract = "“To what extent do plastic strain gradients affect the strengthening resulting from the transformation of small metastable inclusions into hard inclusions within a plastically deforming matrix?” is the central question addressed here. Though general in the approach, the focus is on the behavior of TRIP-assisted multiphase steels. A two-dimensional embedded cell model of a simplified microstructure composed of a single metastable austenitic inclusion surrounded by a soft ferritic matrix is considered. The cell is inserted in a large homogenized medium. The transformation of a fraction of the austenite into a hard martensite plate is simulated, accounting for a transformation strain, and leading to complex elastic and plastic accommodation. The size of a transforming plate in real multiphase steels is typically between 0.1 and 2μm, a range of size in which plastic strain gradient effects are expected to play a major role. The single parameter version of the Fleck–Hutchinson strain gradient plasticity theory is used to describe the plasticity in the austenite, ferrite and martensite phases. The higher order boundary conditions imposed on the plastic flow have a large impact on the predicted strengthening. Using realistic values of the intrinsic length parameter setting the scale at which the gradients effects have an influence leads to a noticeable increase of the strengthening on top of the increase due to the transformation of a volume fraction of the retained austenite. The geometrical parameters such as the volume fraction of retained austenite and of the transforming zone also bring significant strengthening. Strain gradient effects also significantly affect the stress state inside the martensite plate during and after transformation with a potential impact on the damage resistance of these steels."
